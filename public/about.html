<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>   Hello, I'm E Sai Teja Goud, a recent graduate from Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT), 
  Hyderabad, with a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, 
  I've nurtured a strong foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical applications. 
  My skills span across various domains of technology, from programming languages like Python to
  web development frameworks such as React.js and Node.js. I find immense joy in delving into the 
  intricacies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create immersive web experiences. When I'm not immersed 
  in code, you can often find me glued to the screen, enjoying a good TV show, or out on the cricket field,
  honing my skills and enjoying the thrill of the game. Music is my constant companion, providing solace
  and inspiration in equal measure. Above all, I cherish the moments spent with my family, as they are
  my pillars of strength and support. With a relentless drive for learning and growth, I'm excited to
  embark on a journey where I can leverage my skills and passion to make meaningful contributions in
  the world of technology..</p>
